# 9-puzzle-solver

9-puzzle is a variant of 8-puzzle game. Here is a snaphot of 9-puzzle in its goal state:

-----
|   |
-------------
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
-------------
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
-------------
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
-------------

The program generates and solves 25 distinct 9-puzzle problems using a search algorithm chosen by the user among:
1.Breadth First Search
2.Depth First Search
3.Best First Search
4.Beam Search
5.Branch and Bound Search
6.A*

Finally, the program prints out the trace of one of the 25 puzzles.

Note: the problem was an assignment in CS461 (Artificial Intelligence) course at Bilkent in Spring 2018-19
All the algorithms are based on Prof. Winston's book Artifical Intelligence.
